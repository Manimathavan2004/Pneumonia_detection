# Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to detect **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It leverages deep learning techniques to classify images as **Normal** or **Pneumonia**, helping in early and accurate medical diagnosis.

## 🧠 Model Used

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras
- Accuracy: Achieved over 90% validation accuracy

## 📁 Dataset

Dataset used: [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

- 3 folders: `train/`, `val/`, and `test/`
- Each contains images in two subfolders: `NORMAL/` and `PNEUMONIA/`
